## üìö Introduction

This repository contains my personal practice code and exercises developed while completing the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. As I progressed through the 8-course program, I occasionally wrote hands-on code in VS Code to reinforce learning concepts, especially when encountering advanced topics that required practical implementation. This repository showcases my learning journey and practical application of data science concepts.

**Note: This repository is created solely for personal practice and learning purposes.**
